The final data set has 180 rows and 88 columns. There are three types of variables:
Subject: First column, this tells you what person is being measured
Exercise: Second column, this tells you what exercise is being performed
Every other column: This gives you the average for that subject in
that exercise for the given measurement. There are a grand total of 88 measurements.
Each measurement corresponds to a measurement done with an accelerometer or a 
gyroscope. A variable with a t means units are in second, a variable with f means 
units are in frequency units of Hz. Each measurement, in turn, is actually the
average of a set of original measurements that themselves were averages or standard
deviations of  measurements. 

What follows is a technical description of the data which is actually directly from 
the features_info.txt file available at 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
